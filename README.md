# Sovol Sv08 with Box Turtle
You will find here all the files needed to upgrade your Sovol Sv08 with a box turtle and XOL toolhead. This is a work in progress so please bear with me. <br />
<br />
This will hopefully have everything that you need to do a conversion. It has taken me several months to get this up and running and I will also be updating this as I go, so excuse the gramar and layout.  <br />
 <br />

 Here is a list of what I currently have.

 Sovol SV08 Printer
 XOL-Metrix Toolhead
 Octopus Pro (Canbus)
 BTT EBB36 (Canbus)
 BTT Eddy-Duo (Canbus)
 AFC-Lite (Box Turtle controller / Canbus)
 Box Turtle MMU
 ABP Poop management (under development)
